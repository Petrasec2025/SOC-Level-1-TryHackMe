Learn the basics of traffic analysis with Wireshark and how to find anomalies on your network!

**Link:** [TryHackMe Wireshark Traffic Analysis](https://tryhackme.com/room/wiresharktrafficanalysis)

> ‚ÄúIn this room, we will cover the techniques and key points of traffic analysis with Wireshark and detect suspicious activities. Note that this is the third and last room of the Wireshark room trio, and it is suggested to visit the first two rooms stated below to practice and refresh your Wireshark skills before starting this one.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúIn the first two rooms, we have covered how to use Wireshark and do packet-level searches. Now, it is time to investigate and correlate the packet-level information to see the big picture in the network traffic, like detecting anomalies and malicious activities. For a security analyst, it is vital to stop and understand pieces of information spread in packets by applying the analyst‚Äôs knowledge and tool functionality. This room will cover investigating packet-level details by synthesising the analyst knowledge and Wireshark functionality for detecting anomalies and odd situations for a given case.‚Äù

## Conclusion

This room teaches **packet-level traffic analysis**, **anomaly detection**, **cleartext protocol investigation**, **encrypted traffic decryption**, and **network attack identification**. It highlights the importance of combining analyst knowledge with Wireshark functionality to detect malicious behavior, exfiltration attempts, and suspicious network activity.  

The exercises cover TCP/UDP scanning, ARP poisoning, Man-in-the-Middle attacks, DHCP/NetBIOS/Kerberos host identification, tunneling traffic, FTP/HTTP/HTTPS analysis, and practical firewall rules implementation.
