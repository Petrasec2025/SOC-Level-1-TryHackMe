Task 6 Version Differences
Version Differences
As always, it wouldn’t be surprising to see a feature improvement as the version goes up. Unsurprisingly version upgrades provide stability, security fixes and features. Here the feature part is quite tricky. Feature upgrades can represent implementing new features and updating the existing feature (optimisation, alteration or operation mode modification). You can always check the changelog here.

Since there are some significant differences between the versions, the given VM has both of the major versions (v1.6 and v2.7).

Of course, as the program version increases, it is expected to increase feature increase and scope. Here are the significant differences between versions 1.6 and 2.7. Here are the differences;

Mac Address Processing
NetworkMiner versions after version 2 can process MAC address specific correlation as shown in the picture below. This option will help you identify if there is a MAC Address conflict. This feature is not available before version 2.
<img width="676" height="645" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-12 at 6 46 38 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fc7598b-a79f-490f-92db-2da3126f4e52" />
Sent/Received Packet Processing
NetwrokMiner versions up to version 1.6. can handle packets in much detail. These options will help you investigate the sent/received

packets in a more detailed format. This feature is not available after version 1.6.
<img width="679" height="646" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-12 at 6 46 49 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/190a7a0c-71ca-48bd-b14d-b525a13130e0" />
Frame Processing
NetworkMiner versions up to version 1.6. can handle frames. This option provides the number of frames and essential details about the frames. This feature is not available after version 1.6.
<img width="680" height="647" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-12 at 6 47 03 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b34c278c-db13-4135-b8be-7e93c5bc3c92" />
Parameter Processing
NetworkMiner versions after version 2 can handle parameters in a much more extensive form. Therefore version 1.6.xx catches fewer parameters than version 2.

<img width="676" height="643" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-12 at 6 47 14 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71e38644-1040-480e-be34-879e21ac9aaf" />
Cleartext Processing
NetworkMiner versions up to version 1.6. can handle cleartext data. This option provides all extracted cleartext data in a single tab; it is beneficial to investigate cleartext data about the traffic data. However, it is impossible to match the cleartext data and packets. This feature is not available after version 1.6.
<img width="679" height="644" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-12 at 6 47 23 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26cc01dc-8e42-43eb-b2c3-fb6433cf90e5" />
Answer the questions below
Since the answers can be found above, I won’t be posting the answer below. You can follow along to help you discover where they are.

Which version can detect duplicate MAC addresses?
Scroll up to the Mac Address Processing section, if you read through the small paragraph you discover which version can detect duplicate MAC addresses. Look at the screenshots, the version located at the top of each NetworkMiner instants, is used for the answers. Once you find it, type the answer into the TryHackMe answer field, then click submit.

Task 7: Exercises
You’ve learned what NetworkMiner is and how to use it. Let’s put this into practice!

Questions
Use case1.pcap. What is the OS name of the host 131.151.37.122?
Go ahead and open case1.pcap (File > Open). I will use Network Miner 2.7.2 for these first questions. Stay on the Hosts menu.
<img width="910" height="593" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-12 at 6 55 36 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6367bf8a-720c-4e23-bdf9-7ae3d295b544" />
You should see the right IP address in the list. Open the dropdown and underneath OS: Windows you should see the answer: Windows – Windows NT 4.

Answer: Windows – Windows NT 4

Investigate the hosts 131.151.37.122 and 131.151.32.91.
How many data bytes were received from host 131.151.32.91 to host 131.151.37.122 through port 1065?
This one is a bit more difficult to find, but still doable.

Find the receiving host (131.151.37.122) and underneath Incoming sessions, you can find that it has received 192 data bytes.
Alternatively, you can look under the sending host (131.151.32.91) and underneath Outgoing sessions, you can also find that it has sent 192 to the other host.
<img width="902" height="556" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-12 at 6 56 18 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6aba0f3a-3779-48c1-9564-9dc7b4848102" />
Answer: 192
Investigate the hosts 131.151.37.122 and 131.151.32.21.
How many data bytes were received from host 131.151.37.122 to host 131.151.32.21 through port 143?
To be honest, this question really confused me. The question asks about data received by the 131.151.32.21 host, but the right answer is to be found underneath that hosts sessions information, and then Outgoing sessions. This does not make sense to me as it should be an incoming question.
<img width="895" height="590" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-12 at 6 56 27 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69aeb569-eac7-4b38-9f23-16574461ac07" />
I am not sure if this is a mistake or if I misunderstand the question. Anyway, we got the answer: 20769 bytes.

Answer:20769

What is the sequence number of frame 9?
We need to look at frames, and therefore we need to switch to NetworkMiner 1.6.1 *sigh*.
Go to the Frames menu and find frame 9.
<img width="903" height="448" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-12 at 6 56 36 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0650fa5a-c70a-4955-a22d-21e2139edee0" />
The sequence number is part of the TCP protocol. TCP uses sequence numbers in the TCP header to keep track of bytes sent and received.
The initial sequence number (ISN) is chosen randomly and increments with each byte of data.

Anyway, the answer is there: 2AD77400.

Answer:2AD77400

What is the number of the detected “content types”?
We need to use the parameters menu here, which is empty on version 1.6.1. So back to version 2.7.2. we go.

Simply look for the parameter name Content-Type. You can use the Filter keyword input if you want.
<img width="910" height="598" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-12 at 6 58 35 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/136aa807-f5a6-4e10-ba29-d75d5279ff42" />
They are interested in the number of unique content types, which are: text/plain and multipart/mixed. So the number is 2.

Answer: 2

Use case2.pcap. Investigate the files. What is the USB product’s brand name?
Go ahead and load case2.pcap.

USB product’s brand name…hmm. This requires more analysis I guess. Let’s have a look around.

I quickly found a lead inside of the Images menu. There is an image of a USB key in the fourth row. Looking at the image does not show a brand, but Network Miner has reconstructed the source domain which includes the brand name: www.asix.com.tw.

What is the name of the phone model?
I guess we should keep looking for images to find our phone. And I had to keep looking for a while, since I had trouble finding it! But there is a Lumia 535 image out there:

What is the source IP of the fish image?

Task 8: Conclusion
Congratulations! You just finished the NetworkMiner room. 

In this room, we covered NetworkMiner, what it is, how it operates, and how to investigate pcap files. As I mentioned in the tasks before, there are a few things to remember about the NetworkMiner;

Don’t use this tool as a primary sniffer.
Use this tool to overview the traffic, then move forward with Wireshark and tcpdump for a more in-depth investigation.
If you like this content, make sure you visit the following rooms later on THM;

Wireshark
Snort

Congratulations on completing NetworkMiner
Congratulations on finishing this walkthrough of the TryHackMe NetworkMiner room. I think it was a good introduction to the program, and it does help a lot with getting more valuable data from your network traffic processed into “boxes”.
I was overall not very impressed with the software, and it seems a bit old fashioned. But I guess it makes for a great quick overview of the data before diving in with other software.

Come back soon for more walkthroughs of rooms on TryHackMe and HackTheBox, and other Cybersecurity discussions.
