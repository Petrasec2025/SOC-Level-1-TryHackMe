- How would I navigate through the platform?  
- What functionalities will be important during a security threat analysis?  

**Prerequisites:**  
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework  
- TheHive  
- MISP

## Task 2 ‚Äì Introduction to OpenCTI  

Cyber Threat Intelligence is typically a managerial mystery to handle, with organisations battling with how to input, digest, analyse and present threat data in a way that will make sense. From the rooms linked on the overview, it is clear there are numerous platforms developed to tackle Threat Intelligence.  

**OpenCTI**  
OpenCTI is another open-sourced platform designed to provide organisations with the means to manage CTI through the storage, analysis, visualisation and presentation of threat campaigns, malware, and IOCs.  

**Objective**  
Developed by the collaboration of the French National cybersecurity agency (ANSSI), the platform‚Äôs main objective is to create a comprehensive tool that allows users to capitalise on technical and non-technical information while developing relationships between each piece of information and its primary source. OpenCTI can use the MITRE ATT&CK framework to structure data and integrate with tools such as MISP and TheHive.

## Task 3 ‚Äì OpenCTI Data Model  

OpenCTI uses a variety of knowledge schemas in structuring data, the main one being the **Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX2)** standards. STIX is a serialised and standardised language format used in threat intelligence exchange. It allows for the data to be implemented as entities and relationships, effectively tracing the origin of the information.  

![Data Model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16234556-246a-4e2f-b274-1dc0d2d5ba95)  

**Highlight services include:**  
- **GraphQL API:** Connects clients to the database and messaging system.  
- **Write workers:** Python processes to write queries asynchronously from RabbitMQ messaging system.  
- **Connectors:** Python processes used to ingest, enrich, or export data on the platform. Connectors fall under ingestion, enrichment, and export classes.  

![Connectors](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/750656f5-e48e-445b-a1b0-039d957af05a)  

Refer to the OpenCTI connectors and data model documentation for more details.

## üèÅ Conclusion  

Working through this room gave me a **hands-on understanding of OpenCTI** and how it centralizes threat intelligence. I learned to navigate through malware, campaigns, attack patterns, and indicators, exploring relationships between entities and understanding how analysts perform investigations.  

I found the dashboards intuitive and informative, especially when analyzing entities like **Cobalt Strike** and **4H RAT**, and understanding the relationships with threat actors and intrusion sets.  

Overall, this room **strengthened my skills in threat intelligence and investigative analysis**, giving me confidence to use OpenCTI in real-world scenarios. It‚Äôs a great starting point for anyone interested in **cyber threat intelligence and SOC workflows**.
