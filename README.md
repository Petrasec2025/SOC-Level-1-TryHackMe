## 📌 About the Pathway  

The pathway covers **threat detection, analysis, and incident response** using industry-standard SOC tools and frameworks:  

- **Frameworks & Models** – MITRE ATT&CK, Cyber Kill Chain, Unified Kill Chain, Diamond Model, Pyramid of Pain  
- **SIEM Tools** – Splunk, ELK Stack  
- **Network & Traffic Analysis** – Wireshark, TShark, Zeek, NetworkMiner  
- **Endpoint Security & Monitoring** – Sysinternals, Sysmon, Osquery, Wazuh  
- **Digital Forensics** – Autopsy, Redline, KAPE, Volatility, Velociraptor  
- **Phishing Investigations** – Email analysis, prevention techniques  

🎯 **Goal**: Build practical SOC skills, become globally job-ready, and mentor/train junior cybersecurity professionals.
