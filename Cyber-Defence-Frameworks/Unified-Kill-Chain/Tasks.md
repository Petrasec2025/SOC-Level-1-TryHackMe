## Task 1: Introduction

![Task 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c9c9d13-e95f-4c90-aea5-a3e75a66a709)

Understanding the behaviours, objectives and methodologies of a cyber threat is a vital step to establishing a strong cybersecurity defence (known as a cybersecurity posture).

In this room, you will be introduced to the **UKC framework** that is used to help understand how cyber attacks occur.

**Learning Objectives:**

* Understanding why frameworks such as the UKC are important and helpful in establishing a good cybersecurity posture
* Using the UKC to understand an attacker‚Äôs motivation, methodologies and tactics
* Understanding the various phases of the UKC
* Discover that the UKC is a framework that is used to complement other frameworks such as MITRE

## Task 2: What is a ‚ÄúKill Chain‚Äù

![Task 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32bf04a7-7324-472b-a5b4-0f9f4b69c013)

Originating from the military, a **‚ÄúKill Chain‚Äù** is a term used to explain the various stages of an attack. In cybersecurity, it describes the methodology/path attackers use to approach and intrude a target.

**Example:** An attacker scanning, exploiting a web vulnerability, and escalating privileges is a ‚ÄúKill Chain‚Äù.

**Objective:** Understand an attacker‚Äôs ‚ÄúKill Chain‚Äù to put defensive measures in place.

**Question:**

* Where does the term ‚ÄúKill Chain‚Äù originate from?
  *Answer hint: The first sentence of this task.*

## Task 3: What is ‚ÄúThreat Modelling‚Äù

![Task 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3967eed-302b-4a08-b38e-ab2092071256)

Threat modelling is a series of steps to improve the security of a system, essentially:

1. Identify systems and applications to secure
2. Assess vulnerabilities and potential exploits
3. Create a plan of action to secure systems
4. Implement policies to prevent future vulnerabilities

Threat modelling reduces risk within a system or application and gives an overview of IT assets.

**Frameworks used in Threat Modelling:** STRIDE, DREAD, CVSS

**Question:**

* What is the technical term for a piece of software or hardware in IT?
  *Answer hint: End of the explanatory sentence above.*

## Task 4: Introducing the Unified Kill Chain

![Task 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12e775bf-1412-4be6-8383-72d311c8bf48)

* Published in 2017, the UKC complements other frameworks like Lockheed Martin‚Äôs and MITRE ATT\&CK.
* **18 phases** of an attack: From reconnaissance to exfiltration, including attacker motivation.
* UKC advantages: Modern, detailed, covers entire attacks, realistic (phases may recur).

![UKC Benefits](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3463b7c-5e5d-41cf-a6d6-3813b6a57389)

**Questions:**

* In what year was the Unified Kill Chain framework released?
* How many phases are there in an attack according to UKC?
* Name of the attack phase where an attacker employs techniques to evade detection?
* Name of the attack phase where an attacker removes data from a network?
* Name of the attack phase where an attacker achieves their objectives?

## Task 5: Phase ‚Äì Initial Foothold

![Task 5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6015d836-09d3-4572-bcf4-23c19b95e626)

**Focus:** Attacker gains access to a system/network. Techniques include reconnaissance, persistence, and initial exploitation.

### Phases & MITRE Tactics

* **Reconnaissance (TA0043):** Gather info about target
* **Weaponization (TA0001):** Prepare attack infrastructure
* **Social Engineering (TA0001):** Manipulate employees (e.g., phishing)
* **Exploitation (TA0002):** Exploit vulnerabilities to execute code
* **Persistence (TA0003):** Maintain access (e.g., backdoors, services)
* **Defence Evasion (TA0005):** Evade defenses (firewalls, AV, IDS)
* **Command & Control (TA0011):** Establish attacker communications
* **Pivoting (TA0008):** Access other network systems

**Questions:**

* Example of a tactic to gain foothold using emails? **Answer:** Phishing
* Impersonating an employee to request password reset? **Answer:** Social Engineering
* Setting up Command & Control server infrastructure? **Answer:** Command & Control
* Exploiting a vulnerability on a system? **Answer:** Exploitation
* Moving from one system to another? **Answer:** Pivoting
* Leaving behind a malicious service for re-entry? **Answer:** Persistence
