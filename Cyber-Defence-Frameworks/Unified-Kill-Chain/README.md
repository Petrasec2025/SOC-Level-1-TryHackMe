## Overview
The **Unified Kill Chain (UKC)** room on TryHackMe introduces a modern cybersecurity framework for understanding the lifecycle of cyberattacks.  
It helps security professionals, threat hunters, and SOC analysts analyze attacker behavior, tactics, and objectives to strengthen an organization’s cybersecurity posture.  

The UKC complements traditional frameworks like **Lockheed Martin’s Cyber Kill Chain** and **MITRE ATT&CK**, featuring **18 distinct attack phases**.

---

## Objectives
- Understand the significance of cybersecurity frameworks like the UKC  
- Analyze attacker tactics, techniques, and objectives  
- Recognize all 18 phases of the Unified Kill Chain  
- Learn how UKC complements other frameworks for threat modeling and defense

---

## Summary
The UKC framework maps an attacker’s journey from initial reconnaissance to achieving objectives, structured in three major phases:

### Initial Foothold
Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Social Engineering, Exploitation, Persistence, Defense Evasion, Command & Control, Pivoting  

### Network Propagation
Discovery, Privilege Escalation, Execution, Credential Access, Lateral Movement  

### Action on Objectives
Collection, Exfiltration, Impact, Achieving Strategic Goals  

The room includes a **practical exercise** where users match attacker actions to UKC phases, revealing the flag:

**Flag:** `THM{*******}`
