## üìù Conclusion

Working through this TryHackMe lab gave me a clear and practical understanding of what it means to be a Junior Security Analyst in a SOC environment. I learned about the responsibilities of a triage specialist, including monitoring alerts, investigating suspicious activity, escalating incidents when necessary, and understanding how different tools like SIEM and EDR support security monitoring.

The hands-on labs were particularly valuable because they allowed me to practice real-world skills such as identifying a malicious IP, escalating events to the right person, and blocking threats at the firewall level. These steps showed me the workflow of how incidents are handled in a SOC, from detection and triage to response and remediation.

One of the most insightful lessons I gained is how critical it is to stay updated with the latest threats and TTPs of attackers. I also realized the importance of teamwork‚Äîknowing when to escalate and collaborate with higher-tier analysts is just as important as detecting the threat itself.

Overall, the labs were engaging, practical, and a great way to build my foundational skills. They reinforced not only the technical side of security operations but also the analytical mindset needed to ask the right questions: How? When? Why?

This experience strengthened my appreciation for SOC analysts, and it gave me more confidence in pursuing the cybersecurity path while preparing me for real-world challenges in security operations.
