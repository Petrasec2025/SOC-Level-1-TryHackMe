## 🔑 Why it matters  
Understanding the **stages of an attack** and the **techniques adversaries employ** helps security teams respond effectively, investigate root causes, and build stronger defences.  

---

## 📌 Key Cyber Defence Frameworks  

- **Cyber Kill Chain**  
  Maps the steps adversaries take, from reconnaissance to actions on objectives, helping identify and prevent intrusions.  

- **Unified Kill Chain**  
  Combines offensive and defensive perspectives to identify risks and mitigate attacks across multiple phases.  

- **Diamond Model**  
  Focuses on the four key elements of intrusions: **Adversary, Infrastructure, Capability, and Victim.**  

- **MITRE ATT&CK**  
  A globally recognized knowledge base of adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).  

- **Pyramid of Pain**  
  Demonstrates how disrupting certain indicators makes life increasingly difficult for adversaries.

## 🎯 For Junior Security Analysts  
Mastering these frameworks is essential—they form the backbone of **incident detection, investigation, and response**.  

---

## 🚀 Takeaway  
A solid understanding of these models isn’t optional—it’s what transforms a good analyst into a **strategic defender**.
