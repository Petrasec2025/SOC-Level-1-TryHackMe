## üìå Lab Description

The **Pyramid of Pain** room on TryHackMe teaches cybersecurity professionals how different **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** impact adversaries and the effectiveness of defensive measures. It highlights that some indicators are easy for attackers to change, while others are much harder, directly affecting detection and response strategies.

Through this lab, I explored:

- The hierarchy of indicators in the Pyramid of Pain:
  - **Hashes**
  - **IP Addresses**
  - **Domain Names**
  - **Network/Host Artifacts**
  - **Tactics, Techniques & Procedures (TTPs)**
- How simple indicators like hashes can be easily changed by attackers, whereas **TTPs** are harder to modify.
- Practical exercises in identifying and analyzing **malware artifacts, malicious IPs, domains, and attack patterns**.
- The role of **threat intelligence** in improving incident response and proactive defense strategies.

This lab combines theoretical understanding with hands-on exercises, enhancing skills in **threat hunting, malware analysis, and SOC operations**.
