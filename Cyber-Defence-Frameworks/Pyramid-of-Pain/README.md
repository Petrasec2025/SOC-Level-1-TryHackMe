Pyramid of Pain â€“ TryHackMe
Description

The Pyramid of Pain room on TryHackMe focuses on teaching cybersecurity professionals how different indicators of compromise (IOCs) impact adversaries and the effectiveness of defensive measures. The room illustrates the concept that some indicators are harder for attackers to change than others, which directly affects the difficulty and effectiveness of detection and response.

Through this room, I explored:

The hierarchy of indicators in the Pyramid of Pain: Hashes, IP Addresses, Domain Names, Network/Host Artifacts, and Tactics, Techniques & Procedures (TTPs).

How simple indicators like hashes can be easily changed by attackers, whereas TTPs are much harder to modify.

Practical exercises in identifying and analyzing malware artifacts, malicious IPs, domains, and attack patterns.

The role of threat intelligence in improving incident response and proactive defense strategies.

This room combines theoretical understanding with hands-on exercises, enhancing skills in threat hunting, malware analysis, and SOC operations.

Key Learning Outcomes

Understanding the Pyramid of Pain and its relevance to cybersecurity defense.

Performing IOC analysis on hashes, IP addresses, domains, and host/network artifacts.

Learning the limitations of traditional detection methods and the importance of focusing on higher-level adversary behaviors (TTPs).

Applying threat intelligence and analytical skills to real-world security scenarios.
