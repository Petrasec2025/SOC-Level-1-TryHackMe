# Pyramid-of-Pain


## Description
Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! This repository showcases my hands-on experience in threat hunting, incident response, malware analysis, and network security exercises. It includes tasks and practical exercises completed from various platforms like TryHackMe, focusing on the **Pyramid of Pain**, TTPs, host and network artifacts, and malware analysis.

This portfolio demonstrates my skills as a **Cybersecurity Analyst**, **SOC Analyst**, and **Threat Hunter**, emphasizing both theoretical understanding and practical application of security concepts.

## Objective
The main objective of this repository is to:

- Document practical exercises in **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** and threat analysis.  
- Showcase proficiency in identifying and analyzing **malware artifacts, hashes, IP addresses, and domain threats**.  
- Demonstrate hands-on knowledge of **network analysis, TTPs (Tactics, Techniques & Procedures), and attack simulations**.  
- Provide resources and references for detection, mitigation, and response strategies for cybersecurity professionals.  
- Build a professional portfolio for recruiters, hiring managers, and collaborators.

## Summary of Key Exercises

### Task Highlights

- **Task 1 – Introduction:**  
  Explored the concept of the **Pyramid of Pain** and its importance in cybersecurity defense, threat hunting, and incident response.

- **Task 2 – Hash Values:**  
  Worked with **MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2** hash functions to identify file integrity and perform IOC lookups. Learned limitations of hash-based detection.

- **Task 3 – IP Address Analysis:**  
  Analyzed IP-based communications from malware, including the detection of **Fast Flux networks** to evade security measures.

- **Task 4 – Domain Names:**  
  Identified malicious domain requests, URL shorteners, and **Punycode attacks**. Learned methods for detecting and analyzing suspicious domains.

- **Task 5 – Host Artifacts:**  
  Investigated host-level artifacts including **malicious executables, registry changes, and suspicious processes**.

- **Task 6 – Network Artifacts:**  
  Performed network packet analysis using **TShark/Wireshark** to identify unusual **User-Agent strings and POST requests**.

- **Task 7 – Tools:**  
  Explored **malware analysis tools**, **detection rules**, and **fuzzy hashing (SSDeep)** to identify similar malicious files.

- **Task 8 – TTPs:**  
  Studied **MITRE ATT&CK Matrix** techniques, focusing on exfiltration and adversary tactics like **Cobalt Strike** deployment.

- **Task 9 – Practical Pyramid of Pain:**  
  Applied all concepts in a static site exercise, completing the **THM{PYRAMIDS_COMPLETE}** challenge.
