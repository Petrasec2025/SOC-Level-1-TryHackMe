## 📖 Overview

This repository contains my **walkthrough and answers** for the [Cyber Kill Chain](https://tryhackme.com) room on **TryHackMe**.

The room explores the **Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain® framework**, which breaks down the stages of a cyber attack from **Reconnaissance to Exfiltration**.

🎯 **Goal:** To understand **attacker methodologies** and learn **defensive strategies** across each stage of the kill chain.
