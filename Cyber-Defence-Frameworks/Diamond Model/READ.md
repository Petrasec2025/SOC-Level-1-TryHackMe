## Core Elements Table

| Element         | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Adversary**   | The attacker or threat actor carrying out the attack.                        |
| **Infrastructure** | Resources and systems used by the adversary (servers, malware hosts).     |
| **Capability**  | Tools, malware, exploits, and techniques used by the adversary.             |
| **Victim**      | Target of the attack, including people, systems, or assets.                 |

## Objectives

By using the Diamond Model, you will be able to:

* Identify elements of a cyber intrusion (breach, attack, or incident)
* Analyze **Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)**
* Understand and communicate the roles of:
  * **Adversary Operator** – the hacker performing the attack
  * **Adversary Customer** – the entity benefiting from the attack
* Recognize **Victim Personae** and **Victim Assets**
* Determine an adversary’s **Capabilities** and **Adversary Arsenal**
* Understand **Infrastructure types**:
  * **Type 1:** Owned/controlled by adversary
  * **Type 2:** Controlled by intermediaries (e.g., malicious domains)
* Apply **Event Meta-Features**: Timestamp, Phase, Result, Direction, Methodology, Resources
* Analyze **Social-Political Component** – motivation of the adversary
* Analyze **Technology Component** – how capability and infrastructure interact
* Build a **Diamond Model** for a given case study and extract actionable intelligence

---

## Summary

The **Diamond Model** provides a structured, scientific approach to intrusion analysis. By identifying the **adversary, victim, capability, and infrastructure**—and adding meta-features, social-political, and technology context—you can:

* Predict adversary behavior  
* Improve defensive strategies  
* Communicate incidents clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
