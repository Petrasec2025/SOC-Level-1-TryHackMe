## Objectives

| Objective | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Identify Intrusion Elements | Breach, attack, or incident identification |
| Analyze APTs | Understand advanced persistent threats |
| Adversary Roles | Operator (performs attack), Customer (benefits from attack) |
| Victim Analysis | Victim personae and assets |
| Adversary Capabilities | Determine skills, tools, and arsenals |
| Infrastructure Types | Type 1: Owned/controlled by adversary<br>Type 2: Controlled by intermediaries (e.g., malicious domains) |
| Event Meta-Features | Timestamp, Phase, Result, Direction, Methodology, Resources |
| Social-Political Component | Motivation of the adversary |
| Technology Component | Interaction of capability and infrastructure |
| Actionable Intelligence | Build Diamond Models from case studies |

## Summary

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Predict Adversary Behavior | Anticipate next moves and attack patterns |
| Improve Defense | Strengthen network, endpoint, and procedural security |
| Clear Communication | Convey incidents to both technical and non-technical audiences |
