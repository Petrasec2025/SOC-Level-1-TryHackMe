The **Diamond Model** is a framework for intrusion analysis, threat hunting, and incident response. It helps map cyberattack activity in a structured, clear manner for both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Overview

* Developed in **2013** by **Sergio Caltagirone, Andrew Pendergast, and Christopher Betz**
* Core features: **Adversary**, **Infrastructure**, **Capability**, **Victim**
* Arranged in a **diamond shape** to show relationships between elements
* Supports **intrusion analysis, threat hunting, incident response, and network defense**
* Explains cyberattacks to both technical and non-technical audiences

---

## Objectives

By using the Diamond Model, you will be able to:

* Identify elements of a cyber intrusion (breach, attack, or incident)
* Analyze **Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)**
* Understand and communicate the roles of:
  * **Adversary Operator** â€“ the hacker performing the attack
  * **Adversary Customer** â€“ the entity benefiting from the attack
* Recognize **Victim Personae** and **Victim Assets**
* Determine an adversaryâ€™s **Capabilities** and **Adversary Arsenal**
* Understand **Infrastructure types**:
  * **Type 1:** Owned/controlled by adversary
  * **Type 2:** Controlled by intermediaries (e.g., malicious domains)
* Apply **Event Meta-Features**: Timestamp, Phase, Result, Direction, Methodology, Resources
* Analyze **Social-Political Component** â€“ motivation of the adversary
* Analyze **Technology Component** â€“ how capability and infrastructure interact
* Build a **Diamond Model** for a given case study and extract actionable intelligence

---

## Summary

The **Diamond Model** provides a structured, scientific approach to intrusion analysis. By identifying the **adversary, victim, capability, and infrastructure**â€”and adding meta-features, social-political, and technology contextâ€”you can:

* Predict adversary behavior  
* Improve defensive strategies  
* Communicate incidents clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
