Overview
The Diamond Model is a foundational framework for intrusion analysis, threat hunting, and incident response. Developed in 2013 by Sergio Caltagirone, Andrew Pendergast, and Christopher Betz, it provides a structured methodology for mapping cyberattack activity. The model's core strength lies in its ability to clearly articulate complex attack scenarios to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Core Concept
The model arranges four core elements in a diamond shape to visually represent the relationships and interactions in a cyber intrusion:

text
      [Adversary]
           ▲
           │
  ┌────────┴────────┐
  │                 │
[Infrastructure] [Capability]
  │                 │
  └────────┬────────┘
           │
        [Victim]
Arrows indicate relationships and interactions between core components.

Core Elements
Element	Description
Adversary	The attacker or threat actor carrying out the attack
Infrastructure	Resources and systems used by the adversary (servers, malware hosts, C2 infrastructure)
Capability	Tools, malware, exploits, and techniques used by the adversary
Victim	Target of the attack, including people, systems, or organizational assets
Expanded Framework Components
Meta-Features
Feature	Description
Timestamp	When the event occurred
Phase	Stage of the attack lifecycle
Result	Outcome of the event (success/failure)
Direction	Flow of the attack (victim-to-infrastructure, etc.)
Methodology	TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) used
Resources	Assets required to execute the capability
Social-Political Component
Aspect	Description
Adversary Operator	The hacker(s) performing the attack
Adversary Customer	Entity benefiting from the attack (may differ from operator)
Motivation	Driver behind the attack (financial, political, ideological)
Victim Analysis
Component	Description
Victim Personae	Profiles and characteristics of victims
Victim Assets	Specific assets targeted by the adversary
Technology Component
Aspect	Description
Infrastructure Type 1	Owned/controlled directly by adversary
Infrastructure Type 2	Controlled by intermediaries (compromised systems, malicious domains)
Capability Implementation	How tools and techniques are deployed
Key Objectives
By applying the Diamond Model, security professionals can:

Systematically analyze cyber intrusions, breaches, and incidents

Understand Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and their operation

Differentiate roles between Adversary Operators and Adversary Customers

Identify targeting patterns through Victim Personae and Asset analysis

Catalog adversary capabilities and tools (Adversary Arsenal)

Classify infrastructure types and their purposes

Apply meta-features for comprehensive event analysis

Contextualize attacks through social-political and technological lenses

Generate actionable intelligence for defensive improvements

Practical Application
The Diamond Model enables security teams to:

Predict adversary behavior based on established patterns

Improve defensive strategies by understanding attack methodologies

Communicate effectively about incidents across technical and leadership teams

Correlate events across multiple incidents to identify campaign activity

Support threat hunting by providing a structured analysis framework

Complementary Frameworks
The Diamond Model works effectively alongside other security frameworks:

MITRE ATT&CK - For understanding adversary TTPs

Cyber Kill Chain - For analyzing attack progression

VERIS - For incident classification and reporting

Summary
The Diamond Model provides a scientific, structured approach to intrusion analysis that moves beyond simple indicator tracking. By examining the relationships between adversary, capability, infrastructure, and victim—enhanced with meta-features and contextual components—security teams can develop deeper insights into cyber threats and build more effective defense strategies.
