The **Diamond Model** is a framework for intrusion analysis, threat hunting, and incident response. It helps map cyberattack activity in a structured, clear manner for both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Overview

* Developed in **2013** by **Sergio Caltagirone, Andrew Pendergast, and Christopher Betz**
* Core features: **Adversary**, **Infrastructure**, **Capability**, **Victim**
* Arranged in a **diamond shape** to show relationships between elements
* Supports **intrusion analysis, threat hunting, incident response, and network defense**
* Explains cyberattacks to both technical and non-technical audiences

## Core Elements Table

| Element           | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Adversary**     | The attacker or threat actor carrying out the attack.                        |
| **Infrastructure**| Resources and systems used by the adversary (servers, malware hosts).       |
| **Capability**    | Tools, malware, exploits, and techniques used by the adversary.             |
| **Victim**        | Target of the attack, including people, systems, or assets.                 |

## Meta-Features & Components Table

| Feature/Component          | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Event Meta-Features**     | Timestamp, Phase, Result, Direction, Methodology, Resources                |
| **Social-Political**        | Motivation of the adversary (financial, political, ideological)            |
| **Technology Component**    | How capability and infrastructure interact                                  |
| **Adversary Operator**      | Hacker performing the attack                                                |
| **Adversary Customer**      | Entity benefiting from the attack                                           |
| **Victim Personae**         | Profiles of victims                                                        |
| **Victim Assets**           | Assets targeted by the adversary                                           |

## Objectives

By using the Diamond Model, you will be able to:

* Identify elements of a cyber intrusion (breach, attack, or incident)
* Analyze **Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)**
* Understand and communicate the roles of **Adversary Operator** and **Adversary Customer**
* Recognize **Victim Personae** and **Victim Assets**
* Determine an adversary’s **Capabilities** and **Adversary Arsenal**
* Understand **Infrastructure types**:
  * **Type 1:** Owned/controlled by adversary
  * **Type 2:** Controlled by intermediaries (e.g., malicious domains)
* Apply **Event Meta-Features**
* Analyze **Social-Political Component**
* Analyze **Technology Component**
* Build a **Diamond Model** for a given case study and extract actionable intelligence

---

## Summary

The **Diamond Model** provides a structured, scientific approach to intrusion analysis. By identifying the **adversary, victim, capability, and infrastructure**—and adding meta-features, social-political, and technology context—you can:

* Predict adversary behavior  
* Improve defensive strategies  
* Communicate incidents clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
