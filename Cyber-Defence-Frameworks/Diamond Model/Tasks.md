## Introduction

The **Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis** was developed by cybersecurity professionals ‚Äî **Sergio Caltagirone, Andrew Pendergast, and Christopher Betz** in 2013.

The model consists of **four core features**:

- **Adversary**
- **Infrastructure**
- **Capability**
- **Victim**

It establishes the **fundamental atomic element** of any intrusion activity. Additional axes include **Social, Political, and Technology** components.

### Why ‚ÄúDiamond Model‚Äù?

The four core features are **edge-connected**, forming the shape of a diamond.  
It enables:

- Real-time intelligence integration
- Event correlation automation
- Classification into adversary campaigns
- Forecasting adversary operations
- Planning mitigation strategies

### Benefits of Learning the Diamond Model

- Identify elements of an intrusion
- Analyze **Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)**
- Explain cyber incidents to **non-technical audiences**
- Apply structured analysis to breaches, intrusions, and attacks

---

## Task 1 ‚Äì Adversary

An **adversary** is also known as an **attacker, hacker, or threat actor**.  

- Responsible for using **capabilities against victims** to achieve intent
- Knowledge of the adversary is often **unknown during initial discovery**
- Distinguish between **adversary operator** and **adversary customer**

### Key Terms

- **Adversary Operator** ‚Äì Person(s) conducting the intrusion  
- **Adversary Customer** ‚Äì Entity benefiting from the cyberattack  

**Questions:**

1. Term for person/group intending malicious actions?  
   **Answer:** Adversary Operator  

2. Term for person/group benefiting from the attack?  
   **Answer:** Adversary Customer

---

## Task 2 ‚Äì Victim

A **victim** is the target of the adversary and can include:

- Organizations, individuals, IPs, domains, emails, etc.
- Victim Persona: People/organizations targeted
- Victim Assets: Systems, networks, accounts, email addresses  

**Example:** Spear-phishing targeting a specific employee.

**Question:**

- Term for organizations/people being targeted?  
  **Answer:** Victim Personae

---

## Task 3 ‚Äì Capability

**Capability** includes skills, tools, and techniques used by the adversary (TTPs).  

- Can range from **manual attacks** to **malware development**
- **Capability Capacity** ‚Äì vulnerabilities exploited by a capability
- **Adversary Arsenal** ‚Äì Set of capabilities belonging to an adversary

**Question:**

- Term for set of tools/capabilities of an adversary?  
  **Answer:** Adversary Arsenal

---

## Task 4 ‚Äì Infrastructure

**Infrastructure** refers to the **physical or logical resources** used by the adversary:

- Software, hardware, C2 servers, IPs, domains, emails, USB devices
- **Type 1 Infrastructure** ‚Äì Controlled/owned by adversary
- **Type 2 Infrastructure** ‚Äì Controlled by intermediaries to obfuscate attribution
- **Service Providers** ‚Äì Critical support (ISPs, domain registrars, email providers)

**Questions:**

1. Malicious domains and compromised emails?  
   **Answer:** Type 2 Infrastructure  

2. Infrastructure most likely owned by adversary?  
   **Answer:** Type 1 Infrastructure

---

## Task 5 ‚Äì Event Meta Features

Meta-features add intelligence to the Diamond Model:

1. **Timestamp** ‚Äì Date/time of event
2. **Phase** ‚Äì Stage of intrusion (Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command & Control, Actions on Objective)
3. **Result** ‚Äì Success, Failure, Unknown; can map to CIA triad
4. **Direction** ‚Äì Flow of events (Victim‚ÜíInfrastructure, Infrastructure‚ÜíVictim, etc.)
5. **Methodology** ‚Äì General classification (Phishing, DDoS, Breach, etc.)
6. **Resources** ‚Äì External resources required (software, knowledge, hardware, funds, access)

**Questions:**

1. ‚ÄúEvery malicious activity contains two or more phases‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Üí **Phase**  
2. Label event as success/failure/unknown ‚Üí **Result**  
3. ‚ÄúEvery intrusion event requires one or more external resources‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Üí **Resources**

---

## Task 6 ‚Äì Social-Political Component

- Describes **adversary needs and intent** (financial gain, hacktivism, espionage)
- Scenario: Victim provides product (e.g., computing resources) and adversary gains benefit

---

## Task 7 ‚Äì Technology Component

- Shows relationship between **capability and infrastructure**
- Example: **Watering-hole attack** ‚Äì adversary compromises websites frequented by target victims

---

## Task 8 ‚Äì Practice Analysis

- Deploy the static site attached in the task
- Extract information to populate the Diamond Model
- Complete all **eight areas of the diamond**

**Flag:**  
`THM{DIAMOND_MODEL_ATTACK_CHAIN}`

## Conclusion

This room provided a **practical and structured approach** to cyber intrusion analysis. Key takeaways:

- Break down attacks into **Adversary, Victim, Capability, Infrastructure**
- Use meta-features (**Phase, Result, Resources**) to enhance analysis
- Social-Political and Technology components help understand motives and methods
- Useful for communicating with **non-technical stakeholders**
- Reinforces **threat hunting, incident response, and intrusion analysis skills**

The Diamond Model is a **valuable tool** for real-world cybersecurity operations.
