## Room Description

**Eviction** is a SOC Level 1 room that focuses on understanding **Cyber Defence Frameworks** and how adversaries operate using the **MITRE ATT&CK** methodology.

In this room, you will follow the story of **Sunny**, a SOC analyst at **E-corp**, a company that manufactures rare earth metals for government and non-government clients. Sunny receives a **classified intelligence report** that indicates an **APT group (APT28)** might be targeting organizations similar to E-corp.

## Task 1: Understand the Adversary

Sunny’s objective is to leverage the **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator** to:

- Identify the **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)** used by APT28  
- Ensure that the APT has **not already compromised the network**  
- Stop the APT if it has attempted any intrusion  

This task will guide you through analyzing the MITRE ATT&CK framework to understand how advanced persistent threats operate and which controls can be used to detect and prevent attacks.

> **Note:** Please visit the [MITRE ATT&CK Navigator Layer](https://static-labs.tryhackme.cloud/sites/eviction/) provided to explore the TTPs associated with APT28.
