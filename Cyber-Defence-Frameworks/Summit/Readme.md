## Room Overview

**Summit** is a **purple-team simulation room** on TryHackMe that helps learners improve their **malware detection and prevention skills** in a realistic environment. This room simulates internal user workstations where an adversary attempts to execute malware, while you configure security tools to detect and stop threats.

The room emphasizes understanding the **Pyramid of Pain**, a cybersecurity framework that ranks attack indicators based on how difficult they are for an attacker to change. By detecting and mitigating threats at different levels, you increase the attacker’s operational cost.

---

## Objectives

- Conduct **iterative malware detection exercises** in a purple-team scenario.
- Apply defensive strategies to **stop malware execution** using multiple detection methods.
- Map real-world detection techniques to the **Pyramid of Pain**, progressively addressing:

  1. **Trivial indicators** like hashes.
  2. **Network indicators** like IPs and domains.
  3. **Behavioral indicators** like registry changes or unusual processes.

---

## Skills Practiced

- Malware Analysis & Threat Hunting
- Firewall and DNS Rule Management
- Sigma Rule Creation for Behavioral Detection
- Incident Response & Detection Engineering
- Applying MITRE ATT&CK techniques in practical scenarios

---

## Room Prerequisites

It is recommended to complete the following rooms/modules before attempting Summit:

- **The Pyramid of Pain** — Learn about the hierarchy of attack indicators.
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** — Understand how to map tactics and techniques for detection.

---

## Why Take This Room

- Gain **hands-on experience** in a simulated corporate network environment.
- Learn to **detect malware at multiple levels**, from simple hashes to complex behavior patterns.
- Understand how **purple-team exercises** can strengthen overall organizational defenses.
- Prepare for real-world scenarios in **cybersecurity roles**, including SOC analyst, threat hunter, and incident responder.

---

## Additional Notes

This room is **subscriber-only** and is ideal for cybersecurity learners who want to gain **practical experience with malware analysis, threat hunting, and detection engineering** in a controlled environment. Following the Pyramid of Pain helps you understand the **cost of evasion for attackers** and the **importance of layered defenses**.
