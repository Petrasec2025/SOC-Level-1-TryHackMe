## Overview
The final room before we head over to the SIEM rooms. I've already done the Splunk rooms so I won't have a write-up for those. I remember that I didn't struggle too much in them though. I just did a lot of clicking around when I found something interesting.

## Task 1 Introduction

### Question 1: When was Wazuh released?
Found in the introduction.

**Answer:** `2015`

### Question 2: What is the term that Wazuh calls a device that is being monitored for suspicious activity and potential security threats?
This was in the reading. It's the relationship between this and manager.

**Answer:** `Agent`

### Question 3: Lastly, what is the term for a device that is responsible for managing these devices?
I wasn't able to really find it in the readings so I checked the hint.

**Answer:** `Manager`

## Task 2 Required: Deploy Wazuh Server

While I can't RDP here, it said to connect to TryHackMe's network then type the IP address. If you don't know how to, my RDP guide will at least tell you how to get your open vpn profile and get on TryHackMe's network.

Once you get in the network, open your virtual machine's browser and type in the IP address. It should be listed in the question for task 2. The IP is different every time you start it up. Then enter the credentials obtained from the reading.

## Task 4 Wazuh Vulnerability Assessment & Security Events

### Question 1: How many "Security Event" alerts have been generated by the agent "AGENT-001"?
First, we will navigate to the agent page again. This time, we will click on the agent named "agent-001." Then we will click on "Security events" at the top left.

![Security Events](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59f4dfe4-fd3a-4ff1-b070-f78f9e1b404f)

Next, we will be presented with a search bar. On the right side of it, we will edit the time. I simply changed it to "Years ago" instead.

![Time Filter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/225e5a53-ed94-4a26-a12b-c6c385243a25)

After changing it and updating it, it should display the security events alert.

![Security Events Count](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ce05575-6bfa-4345-9f4c-815eaa4b3d71)

**Answer:** `196`

### Question 4: Use the API console to find the Wazuh server's version.
First, we need to get to the API Console. This can be done by going to the top left and clicking on the Wazuh icon, clicking on tools, and then clicking on API Console.

![API Console](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9409744e-33bc-4c76-91ac-fe49a5d9debe)

After that, we are presented with some queries already! To execute a line of code, we click on the line with the code you want to execute and a play button should appear.

![API Play Button](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/400143bd-2ed3-4893-a036-e56a6c29a81b)

Clicking play will execute the command. Then we just look at the output. I clicked through all of them to find the server information.

**Answer:** `v4.2.5`

## Task 11 Generating Reports with Wazuh

### Question 1: Analyse the report. What is the name of the agent that has generated the most alerts?
First we need to generate a report. We will go back to the Security Events section. Click on the Wazuh logo on the top left, then click Modules, then click Security Event. On this page, we generate the report by clicking on "Generate report" on the top right.

![Generate Report](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb2bd4c1-6586-487c-9fa4-9deafc21a5b8)

Now that we generated the report, we will download the file to view it. We do this by going to the Wazuh logo again, then to Management, then finally Reporting.

![Reporting Section](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4c91516-e35a-48dd-876b-f6fe95fca377)

When we find the report we want, we go to the Actions column and click either download or delete.

![Report Actions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b1189a5-ff28-4841-9671-3e24d4c6d5eb)

Since we know we only have one agent, we already know the answer of the name of the agent that generated the most alert. We found the names back in Task 4.

**Answer:** `agent-001`

## Thoughts & Conclusion

Wow. That was another fun room. I suppose I think fun rooms are easy rooms. I did enjoy it because Wazuh seemed like an extensive EDR and also a SIEM together. I did enjoy how easy to use it was. I never heard of Wazuh but I'm glad I was exposed to it!

The room provided excellent hands-on experience with Wazuh, teaching valuable skills in endpoint monitoring, security event analysis, API usage, and report generation. The practical exercises helped reinforce how to manage agents, analyze security events, and utilize Wazuh's comprehensive features for security monitoring and incident response.
