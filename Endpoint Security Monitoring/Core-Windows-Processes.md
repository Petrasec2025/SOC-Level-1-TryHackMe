Looks like we‚Äôre going to be introduced some processes that are vital to Windows, and we can utilize them to detect and investigate our machines. It seems like a great room since a lot of users use Windows, and I believe almost all corporations use Windows too. Being exposed to the tools we have will give us a stronger foundational knowledge of Windows and as a security/SOC anaylst.

## Task 3 System

**1: What PID should System always be?**

From the reading, it said that it is always 4. Out of curiosity, I also checked my own virtual machine and the machine launched on TryHackMe. They were also 4.

**Answer:** 4

---

## Task 4 System > smss.exe

**1: What other two processes do smss.exe start in Session 1? (answer format: process1, process2)**

I checked both csrss.exe and looked for Session 1. The second csrss.exe in the screenshot had it. After that, I looked at winlogon.exe to see if it also had a Session 1, which it did. I used Process Hacker and right clicked the process I was curious about and checked the property. Once the window popped out, I clicked on the ‚ÄúToken‚Äù tab to find the session.

**Answer:** csrss.exe winlogon.exe

---

## Task 5 csrss.exe

**1: What was the process which had PID 384 and PID 488?**

Remember that this process self-terminates, so it will not show itself! We read that from Task 4. In the reading, we are presented with two csrss.exe programs running but their parents are non-existent. That is what gives us the hint we need to get the answer.

**Answer:** smss.exe

---

## Task 6 wininit.exe

**1: Which process might you not see running if Credential Guard is not enabled?**

This one is mentioned in the reading, prefaced with ‚ÄúNote.‚Äù

**Answer:** lsaiso.exe

---

## Task 7 wininit.exe > services.exe

**1: How many instances of services.exe should be running on a Windows system?**

Both the TryHackMe and my own virtual machine did have only one service running, and it had wininit.exe as the parent process.

**Answer:** 1

---

## Task 8 wininit.exe > services.exe > svchost.exe

**1: What single letter parameter should always be visible in the Command line or Binary path?**

I checked using both Process Hacker and Process Explorer. The reading showed us how to check on Process Hacker. For Process Explorer, I just right clicked one of the svchost.exe and clicked on properties. Go to the ‚ÄúImage‚Äù tab and you‚Äôll be able to see the ‚Äúk‚Äù in the ‚ÄúCommand line‚Äù area.

**Answer:** k

## Task 9 lsass.exe

**1: What is the parent process for LSASS?**

I checked on TryHackMe‚Äôs VM. We can see the parent process PID, 668, in this image.

**Answer:** wininit.exe

---

## Task 10 winlogon.exe

**1: What is the non-existent parent process for winlogon.exe?**

Heading back to Task 4, we read that winlogon and wininit is called on by a certain process that self terminates.

**Answer:** smss.exe

---

## Task 11 explorer.exe

**1: What is the non-existent process for explorer.exe?**

Winlogon.exe runs a process, userinit.exe. Userinit.exe then calls explorer.exe and self-terminates. This is why explorer.exe will say it has a non-existent process for the parent.

**Answer:** userinit.exe

## Thoughts

A pretty light room but important one. Admittedly I probably won‚Äôt remember much from this but I‚Äôm glad I got exposed to the important processes Windows has. It will give me a small idea of where to start if I was told we were compromised.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This room highlights the **core Windows processes** that every SOC Analyst and Incident Responder should be aware of. Knowing their expected behavior and parent/child relationships helps in:

* Spotting **malware masquerading as system processes**
* Detecting **non-existent parent anomalies**
* Understanding **startup process chains** (System ‚Üí smss.exe ‚Üí wininit.exe ‚Üí services.exe / lsass.exe / svchost.exe ‚Üí explorer.exe)

Being familiar with these builds a strong foundation for Windows defense and incident investigation.
