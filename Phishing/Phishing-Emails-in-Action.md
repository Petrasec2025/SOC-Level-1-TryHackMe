So that was “Phishing Emails in Action” for you. We learned all the different indicators of phishing attempts by examining actual phishing emails. We started off with an alleged email from PayPal which was regarding cancellation of a order. Next, we looked into tracking scam related to DHL. Further, an Microsoft OneDrive credential harvesting attack. Moving on, a Netflix and Apple support email with a PDF and DOC attachments as lure. At last, looked into a DHL email that has a excel file with macros enabled to run the payload. On that note, i would take your leave and will meet you in next one. Till then, “Happy hacking”.
