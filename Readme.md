## 📌 Overview  

This section of the repository focuses on **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** the practice of collecting, analyzing, and leveraging threat data to detect, prevent, and respond to adversary actions.  

These labs provide **hands-on experience** in:  

- Identifying **threat actors, TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), and IoCs (Indicators of Compromise)**  
- Using **OSINT and threat-sharing tools** to enrich investigations  
- Developing **analytical thinking** for threat hunting and reporting  
- Mapping CTI knowledge to **real-world SOC Analyst workflows**  

---

## 🎯 Skills Gained  

- Threat intelligence frameworks (**MITRE ATT&CK, STIX/TAXII**)  
- Open-source intelligence (**OSINT**) collection & analysis  
- **YARA** rules creation for malware detection and hunting  
- Hands-on experience with **MISP** (Threat Sharing Platform) and **OpenCTI**  
- Case study–based **threat investigation and reporting**

## 🔗 Real-World Relevance  

These labs simulate tasks that **SOC Analysts and Threat Intel teams** perform daily:  

- Tracking adversary campaigns using **OSINT**  
- Writing **YARA rules** to detect malware families  
- Enriching **SIEM alerts** with external threat feeds  
- Sharing and consuming **IoCs** across organizations  
- Producing actionable **intelligence reports** for stakeholders  

👉 The knowledge gained here is **directly applicable** to **defensive operations and incident response** in real-world SOC environments.
